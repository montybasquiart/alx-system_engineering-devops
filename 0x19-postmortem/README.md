# Postmortem: Unexpected Downtime on MYSQL

## Issue Summary

#### Duration:

    * Start Time: August 15, 2024, 02:00 UTC
    * End Time: August 15, 2024, 08:30 UTC

### Impact:
    * The main server was unable to install updates and connect to the MySQL database, causing service disruptions.
    * I experienced issues with accessing the database.
    * Users encountered errors when trying to access any features requiring database connectivity. The website was partially operational, with static content loading but dynamic content failing to load.

### Root Cause:
    * A corrupted MySQL configuration file combined with a full disk on the server led to the inability to start the MySQL service, which in turn prevented the server from installing necessary updates.

### Timeline:
    * 02:00 UTC: Issue detected by automated monitoring system; alerts triggered due to failed database connection and inability to install updates.
    * 02:10 UTC: On-call engineer notified by the alert system.
    * 02:15 UTC: Engineer begins investigating server logs and identifies that MySQL service is down.
    * 02:30 UTC: Initial assumption: MySQL service might have crashed due to high traffic; attempted to restart the service without success.
    * 03:00 UTC: Further investigation into server resources; noticed high disk usage but continued to focus on MySQL service itself.
    * 03:30 UTC: Misleading assumption that the issue was related to recent application code changes; began rolling back the latest deployment.
    * 04:15 UTC: Deployment rollback completed, but issue persisted.
    * 04:30 UTC: Incident escalated to the senior engineering team for deeper investigation.
    * 05:00 UTC: Senior engineers identified the root cause as a full disk that prevented MySQL from writing necessary temporary files.
    * 05:15 UTC: Disk space cleared by removing unnecessary logs and temporary files.
    * 05:30 UTC: MySQL configuration file issue identified and corrected.
    * 06:00 UTC: MySQL service successfully restarted, but the server was still unable to install updates.
    * 06:15 UTC: Further investigation revealed that the update issue was also due to the full disk.
    * 06:45 UTC: Additional space cleared, and updates were successfully applied.
    * 08:00 UTC: Final checks and monitoring to ensure system stability.
    * 08:30 UTC: Issue fully resolved, and services restored to 100% operational status.

### Root Cause and Resolution
### Root Cause:
    * The MySQL configuration file became corrupted, likely due to an improper shutdown during a previous maintenance window. The serverâ€™s disk became full, which prevented MySQL from writing necessary temporary files and also blocked the system from installing updates. This combination of issues caused the database service to fail and updates to halt, leading to widespread service disruption.

### Resolution:
    * The engineering team cleared sufficient disk space by deleting old logs and unnecessary files. The corrupted MySQL configuration file was restored from a backup, and the MySQL service was successfully restarted. After addressing the disk space issue, the server was able to install updates, and all services were restored to full functionality.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures
### Improvements:
    * Implement better disk space monitoring and alerting to prevent full disk issues from occurring unnoticed.
    * Regularly audit and clean up unnecessary files on the server to maintain adequate free disk space.
    * Implement automated configuration file backups and validation checks to detect corruption early.

### Tasks:
    * Set up disk space monitoring with alerts when usage exceeds 80%.
    * Schedule regular cleanup of old logs and temporary files.
    * Automate backup and integrity checks for critical configuration files.
    * Add monitoring for failed service restarts to alert on underlying issues like full disks.
    * Review and improve the incident response process to reduce time spent on misleading investigation paths.
